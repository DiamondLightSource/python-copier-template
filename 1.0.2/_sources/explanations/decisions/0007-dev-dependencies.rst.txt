7. Installing developer environment
===================================

Date: 2023-01-18

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

We need to provide a way to setup a developer environment for a skeleton based
project.

Decision
--------

Use optional dependencies in pyproject.toml.

PEP 621 provides a mechanism for adding optional dependencies in pyproject.toml
https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/#dependencies-optional-dependencies.

We supply a list of developer dependencies under the title "dev". These
developer dependencies enable building and testing the project and
its documentation.

Consequences
------------

Any developer can update their virtual environment in order to work on
a skeleton based project with the command:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```
