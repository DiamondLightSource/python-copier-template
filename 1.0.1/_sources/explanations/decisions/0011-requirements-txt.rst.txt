11. Pinning requirements
========================

Date: 2023-01-18

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

Require the ability to pin requirements for a guaranteed rebuild.
By default CI builds against the latest version of all dependencies, but we
need a mechanism for overriding this behaviour with a lock file
when there are issues.

Decision
--------

Have every release generate requirements.txt files using pip freeze and
publish them as release assets.

Request that the user download the asset and commit it into the repo in order
to lock dependencies for the next CI build.

TODO: link to the How-To on pinning requirements to be written in
python3-pip-skeleton developer documentation.

Consequences
------------

There is less overhead in managing lock files. Incoming issues with dependencies
will be highlighted early but can be worked around quickly if needed.
