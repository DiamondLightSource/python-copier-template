Accepted

Context
-------

We require a mechanism for generating version numbers in python.

Decision
--------

Generate the version number from git tags using setuptools scm.

See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/

Consequences
------------

Versions are generated automatically from git tags. This means you can
can verify if you are running a released version of the code as
setup tools scm adds a suffix to untagged commits.
