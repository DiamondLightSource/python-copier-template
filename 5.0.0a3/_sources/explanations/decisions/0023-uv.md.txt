# 23. Adopt uv

Date: 2025-09-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) appears to be gaining a critical mass of adoption, and adopting the project flow would bring some benefits:
- Much faster venv creation times
- A native lockfile implementation
- A single base image that can install multiple pythons
- Which would allow us to make a single devcontainer base with our feature built in, which would speed up the devcontainer creation time

## Decision

We will adopt this flow.

## Consequences

Docs will need to be updated, especially around lockfile support. Commands will need to be updated slightly for the new version of tox. Work on `renovate` will need to follow as `dependabot` does not support the uv lockfile.
