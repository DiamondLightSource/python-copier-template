Creating a new skeleton fork
============================

There may be some features in the DiamondLightSource skeleton which aren't required,
or some you want to add which Diamond doesn't require. The python3-pip-skeleton can be used
with any ``https://github.com/SomeInstitution/python3-pip-skeleton`` forked from 
``https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python3-pip-skeleton`` by using ``--skeleton-org SomeInstitution``
when implementing the skeleton on a new or existing repo.

The forked skeleton repo has to have the name ``python3-pip-skeleton``. It can be changed however the 
institution requires, then DiamondLightSource's skeleton can be periodically pulled from upstream 
to acquire the latest changes.
