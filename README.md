## Create a new project via Developer Portal

> [!NOTE]
> Template creation from the developer portal is currently under construction, so these instructions do not work yet

Visit <https://dev-portal.diamond.ac.uk/create> and you will see a list of templates that you can create. Pick the one marked `Python Template` and fill in the details of the project.

## Create a new project from the commandline

You will need to `pip install copier` inside an activated `venv`, then you can create a new module via:

```
$ mkdir /path/to/my-project
$ copier copy gh:DiamondLightSource/python-copier-template /path/to/my-project
```

You can also use it via `pipx run copier` if you have that installed.
