# Run in a container

Pre-built containers with {{repo_name}} and its dependencies already
installed are available on [Github Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/{{github_org}}/{{repo_name}}).

## Starting the container

To pull the container from github container registry and run:

```
$ docker run ghcr.io/{{github_org}}/{{repo_name}}:main --version
```

To get a released version, use a numbered release instead of `main`.
